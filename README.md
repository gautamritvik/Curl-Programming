Name: Curl
Purpose: For fun!
Syntax:

	Say something: pcType{[text surrounded by double quotes]}\
	Input: pcAsk{[text surrounded by double quotes]>>}\ (the input answer will later be referred as "input{ans}")
	Storage variable: var{[name of variable, quotes not needed], [variable items, works just like lists]}\ (the variable will later referred as "var{[name of variable]}"
	List: list{[item1]; [item2]; [item3]}\
	Function:
		
			  createFunc{[name of function, quotes not needed]}-     (the function will later be referred as "func{[name of function]}")
(4 spaces or 1 tab) ---->     [code]
			  --\

	Loop:
		1. if{[condition (e.g. var{name} == "Ritvik Gautam")], then}-
		       [code]
		   --\

		2. if{[condition (e.g. var{name} == "Ritvik Gautam")], then}-
		       [code]
		   else:
		       [code]
		   --\

		3. if{[condition (e.g. var{name} == "Ritvik Gautam")], then}-
		       [code]
		   elif{[condition (e.g. var{name} != "Ritvik Gautam")], then}-
		       [code]
		   --\--\

	    [AI's directions surrounded in double quotes], [AI modes (modes are: profanityControl, searchPowers, AImager. Toggles are either (in double quotes) ".on" or ".off")]}\
	Blocks of code from other supported coding languages: otherCoding{[Coding language name in double quotes (supported: "Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "C", "C++", "Node.js")],
